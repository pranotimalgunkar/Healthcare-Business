"Patient Encounter Cost and Risk Analysis in Healthcare Systems"  Healthcare business domain
Healthcare organizations face increasing challenges in managing the costs and financial risks associated with patient encounters. Identifying patients with frequent high-cost encounters, analyzing the impact of various medical procedures, and understanding financial risks due to payer coverage gaps are critical for improving operational efficiency and patient outcomes. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of patient encounters, procedure costs, and payer coverage to uncover patterns of high-cost healthcare utilization and potential financial risks.


Through this analysis, healthcare providers will gain actionable insights into patient demographics, procedure trends, and key factors driving uncovered costs. The objective is to support informed decision-making for resource allocation, patient care management, and financial planning by leveraging SQL-based data analysis across key healthcare tables such as encounters, patients, procedures, payers, and organizations.
